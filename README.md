# What is new in C#11 and C#12

<p>
  C# has always been leading the way in enterprise and desktop application development, evolving continuously to meet the demands of modern software engineering.
  With the introduction of C# 11 and 12, Microsoft continues to push the boundaries, offering advanced features that promise to enhance performance,
  improve code readability, and facilitate the process of developing of robust applications.

## C# 11 Overview
<p>
  In 2022, C# 11 was released together with .NET 7 and introduced a range of new features and enhancements aimed at improving developer productivity,
  enhancing language expressiveness, and optimizing performance. Below are some of the key additions in C# 11:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Raw String Literal</dt>
  <dd>- Allows multi-line strings with no need for escape sequences, improving readability for complex strings.</dd>

  <dt>Required Members</dt>
  <dd>- Enforcing that certain properties must be initialized during object creation, ensuring proper initialization.</dd>
  
  <dt>Newlines in Interpolations</dt>
  <dd>- Supports newlines and nested expressions within string interpolations for more complex formatting.</dd>
  
  <dt>List Patterns</dt>
  <dd>- With C# 11â€™s list patterns, the same check becomes more concise and readable, which eliminates tons of redundant lines of code.</dd>
  
  <dt>Generic Attributes</dt>
  <dd>- You can declare a generic class whose base class is <b>System.Attribute</b>. providing a more flexible and type-safe annotation.</dd>
</dl>

## C# 12 Overview
<p>
  As of C# 12, which was released alongside .NET 8 in 2023, several new features and improvements have been introduced.
  These additions further refines the language with features such as:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Primary Constructors for All Types</dt>
  <dd>- A concise syntax to declare constructors whose parameters are available anywhere in the body of the type.</dd>

  <dt>Default Values for Lambda Parameters</dt>
  <dd>- You can now specify default values in lambda parameters, which makes lambdas more flexible.</dd>

  <dt>Interceptors</dt>
  <dd>- Allows injecting code before or after method execution without modifying the method, cool huh? still experimental tho.</dd>
  
  <dt>Alias Any Type</dt>
  <dd>- You can use the <b>using</b> alias directive to alias any type (eg. array types), not just the usual named types!</dd>
    
  <dt>Collection Expressions</dt>
  <dd>- Introduces a new short syntax to create common collection values, making the code more concise.</dd>
  
</dl>

<p>
  These advancements in C# not only reinforce its position as a powerful tool for software development but also address the evolving needs of developers. As the language continues to evolve, developers can look forward to an even more robust and adaptable environment for crafting modern applications.
